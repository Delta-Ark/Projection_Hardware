###Frame

![togusa](/Users/rachelbrian/Desktop/Projector_Images/_MG_9192.JPG)

The frame is made from a small sheet of plywood, laser cut and press fit and glued together with wood glue.

We began by taking mesurments of the items we knew we had to combine

* Macbook Air
* AAXA M4 Projector
* Battery
* Webcam

Then we figured out the optimal/tightest configuration. This is the result of 3 attempts at this.

On the floor of the frame we cut out 4 holes for the projectors feet, that way it wouldnt shift around and wouldnt fall out when you unscrewed the tripod shoe, which screws directly into the projector.

###Remote

We ran into trouble making it tight because you needed to be able to reach the  projectors buttons and focus knob. Luckly the projector came with a remote so that took care of the buttons. We glued 2 small neodymium magnets to the remote, also laser etched holes for magnets in the wood frame. This way the remote doesnt get lost and still can be used remotely.

###Focus Controler

Still needed a solution for controling the focus.

We came up with this little key like thing that grabs the focus knob. This took a lot fo trial and error to get right. We had to make sure the projector could be taken out and so the key had to be able to pop on and off the focus knob. Though it also needed to not pop off in the field. So we cut a few diffrent lengths of the grabbers to try out. Ended up rounding off the edges so it could pop on and off.

###Wires

Didnt want them looking a mess or getting infront of the lens so we hid them under the laptop. The three peices of wood ontop that look sort of like a fat "I" are there to allow the laptop case to be glued flush to the wood. The case we got has little feet on it. It just happend to make a nice space for the wires to run. Just used some little adhesive wire clips to be safe.

###Battery

First off the battery is mostly here to give the laptop ac power so that the lid can close and it wont sleep. It also is handy for charging but thats its main purpose. 

The battery is ziptied in place we cut notches for the ties to sit in at the back and holes for them to slip through in the front. The battery hangs out of the back a bit so you can still read the labels on the ports. Dont want to get the power in and outs mixed up.
